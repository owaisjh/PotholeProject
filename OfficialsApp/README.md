# Government Official's Application

The officials’ application’s main purpose revolves around the aspect of road repairs. It provides the officials with navigation to pothole locations for ease of movement. For the navigation purposes the official is redirected to the google maps with the corresponding coordinates. There are two different filtering options for the official to make it convenient and easy. The first one is the distance based filtering option in which, the pothole whose distance with the current location of the official is minimum is displayed first. The second option is a priority based filter which uses an algorithm at the backend to assign priority values to the pothole thereby increasing its value and significance.This application allows the officials to validate potholes and update their status accordingly.
